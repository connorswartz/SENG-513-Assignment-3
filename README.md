Game Title: Four or More

Target Platform: Designed for desktop

Game Genre: Strategy

Game Objective(s): This game is meant for two players. The game will end with either one of the two players winning, or the game will end in a draw. For a player to win, they must get a certain amount (this amount is decided before the round starts. Will typically be four, but could be five) of their coloured chips in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Rules of the Game: Each player must place only a single chip on their turn. If one of the two players gets four (could be five depending on settings) of their coloured chips in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, that player wins the game. If the entire board gets filled out and neither of the players has four (or 5) of their chips in a row, the game is a draw and neither player wins this round.

Game Mechanics: The game board starts with a grid of 7x6 available spaces. Either Player 1 (red) or Player 2 (blue) will go first (this can be decided before the game in the options menu, or can be decided at random). On each player's turn, they will place one of their chips into the column of their choosing (provided the column of their choosing is not already full). After placing their a chip, it will then be the other player's turn. This placing of chips will go back and forth until either one of the players has gotten four (or five) of their chips in a row, or until the entire game board has been filled out with player chips. There is also an options menu that can be updated before a new game. In this options menu, players have the choice to decide who goes first between Blue, Red, and Random (Blue is the default if no option is picked). The next option is how many rounds a player needs to win to win the game. The options to choose from are 1, 3, and 5 (1 is the default if no option is chosen). Finally, the last option is the amount of chips in a row a player needs to win. The options are 4 and 5 (4 is the default if no option is picked).
